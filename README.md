This Real Estate Marketplace App provides a complete platform for customers and verified sellers to connect seamlessly. Users can browse properties with advanced filters, explore detailed listings with full descriptions, image galleries, amenities, pricing, and map locations, and directly message sellers through a built-in chat system. Verified sellers receive a dedicated dashboard where they can manage their listings, create new property posts, track revenue and activity, update property status, and communicate with interested buyers in real time. The app also features a Community Page to discover verified sellers, an About page that explains the platform’s purpose, and a helpful FAQs section for quick assistance. Designed with a clean UI and smooth navigation, this project aims to simplify property searching, buying, renting, and selling with an efficient and user-friendly experience.
